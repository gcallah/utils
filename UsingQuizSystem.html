            Using the Quiz System
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Components
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>question_entry.py</b>:
                Allows guided data entry of questions and answers for a 
                particular chapter and section.
                <br />
                Each project will have a script called <b>qentry.sh</b>
                that will run the Python script with proper parameters
                and do the follow-up steps necessary: if you are on Windows,
                you can always look at the script
                and do these steps manually.
                And someone could create a PowerShell script to do the same
                steps...
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>quiz2html.py</b>:
                Takes the delimited text files (CSV files, but we aren't
                using commas as separators!) and turns them into html code
                for inclusion in a web page.
                <br />
                Run it like: ../utils/quiz2html.py quiz1.1.txt &gt; quiz1.1.qhtm
                <br />
                <b>But</b>, you should not have to run this by hand! Use the
                <i>makefile</i> in the quizzes directory.
                <br />
                <b>But</b>, better yet, you shouldn't even have to do 
                that by hand... <i>qentry.sh</i> runs make for you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>quiz2test.py</b>:
                Takes the delimited text files (CSV files, but we aren't
                using commas as separators!) and turns them into 
                stand-alone files suitable for printing as a test.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>html_include.awk</b>:
                Reads the quizzes into the appropriate web pages.
                You will need to enter an include statement in the proper
                place in a <i>*.ptml</i> file, like this (take out the slashes
                when you use this):
                <br />
                <code>
                    \&lt;\!--include quiz6.2.qhtm --&gt;
                </code>
            </li>
			<li>
                <b>qexport.py</b>:
                Exports quiz content from the database and prints it on screen.
				The database configurations are set in mysite/settings.py.
				Quiz material for different modules can be filtered by calling qexport.py
                &lt;module_name&gt;
            </li>
			<li>
                <b>qimport.py</b>:
                Reads a file provided as input and writes them to the database. 
            </li>
			<li>
                <b>qexport.sh</b>:
                Shell script which set database configurations to prod DB and
                calls qexport.py.  This script is encrypted using git-crypt for
                safe keeping of the database credentials.				
            </li>
        </ul>
