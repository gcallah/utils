    <ul>
      Interactive mode (toggled with -i flag): 
      a REPL for addressing typos on-the-go.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Fix words in-place in a file, by opening to the 
      specific line and word in vim.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Add custom words to a custom dictionary (/utils/data/custom-dict.txt).
    </ul>

      Uses Regular Expression to skip words containing any characters other
      than a letter, hyphen or apostrophe.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Exit with error code if aborted while the -i flag is provided,
      or upon encountering a misspelt word when the -i flag is not provided.
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Future Features?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      Currently, the spell-checker is intended to be used to parse
      one html file at a time. This means that for every file parsed,
      the program has to read a large file (the english dictionary)
      from disk. In the future, the program might be changed to process
      files in batches, rather than one-by-one, to avoid this upfront cost.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      It might be worthwhile to rewrite this application in a compiled
      language (or cython?), in order to boost runtime speed.  This
      application's primary activity is parsing, and compiled languages
      are the lingua franca of this arena.  Might consider Rust, or Go.
