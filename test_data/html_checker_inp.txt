                    Program is a command which tells the computer what to do.
                    Programming is an activity of writing and testing such
                    programs.  Computers are dumb, in the sense that they
                    require instructions to complete a certain task that a
                    human can do with common sense.  The language in which
                    instructions are given is the programming language. C++ is
                    our programming language.

                    C++ is a compiled language which means that the code has to
                    be translated to machine instructions before the program is
                    run, by a compiler. (A language like Python translates to
                    machine language as the program is run, without a separate
                    compile step.) Source code is the code you write, for C++
                    the suffix is .cpp. The machine code or object code, is .o
                    (Unix) or .obj (Windows)
