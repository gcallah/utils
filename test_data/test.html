            Program is a command which tells the computer what to do.
            Programming is an activity of writing and testing such
            programs.  Computers are dumb, in the sense that they
            require instructions to complete a certain task that a
            human can do with common sense.  The language in which
            instructions are given is the programming language. C++ is
            our programming language.
        </p>

            C++ is a compiled language which means that the code has to
            be translated to machine instructions before the program is
            run, by a compiler. (A language like Python translates to
            machine language as the program is run, without a separate
            compile step.) Source code is the code you write, for C++
            the suffix is .cpp. The machine code or object code, is .o
            (Unix) or .obj (Windows)
